If there is a problem with the Mysql password issue and cannot connect then follow the below steps:

Step1: brew services stop mysql
Step2: mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables (Start mysqld with grant tables disabled)
Step3: mysql -u root (In an other terminal window)
Step4: FLUSH PRIVILEGES; (Flush the privileges so that we can set the new one)
Step5: ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[Your New Password]';
Step6: Exit the special terminal and then use mysqladmin -u root -pNewStrongPassword! shutdown
Step7: brew services start mysql (Start the mysql again and try)
